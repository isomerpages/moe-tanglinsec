## Grassroot Organizations
<br>
Tanglin Secondary School has identified ‘Strengthening Partnership with Community’ as one of its five strategic thrusts to fulfill its mission to nurture our students to be “Future Ready Tanglinians”. Our curriculum is purposefully designed to include partnership with the community to shape the educational journey of our students.

Southwest CDC and the West Coast Community Club are our key community partners. The collaborations with these grassroots organisations have enriched our students’ learning through the opportunities they provide. Each of these organisations is able to provide authentic learning experiences in the areas of environment education, community involvement, social entrepreneurship, leadership development and character development programme. Through the partnership, our students acquire values such as social responsibility, resilience, respect, integrity, care and harmony. It also develops our students’ ability to reflect on and respond to the community, national and global issues, and to make informed and responsible decisions.

We will continue to tap on the strengths of our grassroots partners. We hope that the continued partnerships will transform every Tanglinian into confident, self-directed learners, active community volunteers and contributing citizens of Singapore.
