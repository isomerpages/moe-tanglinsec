### Principal's Message <br>


<img src="/images/Tanglin%20Principal.jpg" style= "width: 30%; margin-right:15px;" align = "left">
“Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.”

Yesterday. As we look back on the pandemic-disrupted year that is 2021, we are heartened that Tanglin Secondary School has emerged stronger, together.

Together, the staff and students navigated through the challenges to ensure that teaching and learning went on as effectively and in as holistic a manner as possible. Together, the staff and students from our four Visual and Performing Arts CCA rose above themselves to achieve admirable outcomes at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 2021. Together, the staff and students from our two Sports CCA competed with determination and did the school proud at the National School Games 2021.

Together, the teachers learnt and collaborated to find ways to make lessons more engaging, leveraging the affordance of the Personal Learning Device. Together, the teachers designed packages for self-paced learning on Self-directed Learning Days. Together, the teachers facilitated the refreshed CCE curriculum and nurtured Tanglinians in the right values, to the best of their ability.      

Staff, Teachers and Tanglinians – Tanglin Secondary School salutes you.

Together, we were and will continue to be Simply Stronger!

Today. This year, 2022, promises to be an exciting year for the Tanglin Secondary School community.

We will continue to stay true to our mission – sustaining the quality of Tanglin’s <b>innovative and engaging curriculum anchored on our school values<b>. We will strengthen our caring and enabling environment for every Tanglinian to flourish while becoming more resilient. We will promote greater ownership of learning among Tanglinians so as to bring about greater synergy and agency for life.

Guided by our belief that <b>‘Everyone is Unique, All can Succeed’<b>, we will continue to embrace every child regardless of their background, and strive to nurture Tanglinians to become <b>'Leaders of the Future and Pride of the Community’<b> – a people with a strong sense of purpose and motivation to better the lives of others. We will stay focused on this vision so as to enable every Tanglinian to discover more about themselves and live out their potential.

Tomorrow. As our school embarks on the journey towards school merger in 2023, we endeavour to continue doing our best by our students and by our staff. We will relive the pioneering spirit – the ‘can do’ spirit to innovate and be inventive while working together and putting aside differences to embrace this change.

Since its inception 58 years ago, Tanglin Secondary School has served the nation and the community with pride while positively impacting numerous batches of young people. As we celebrate this legacy, we are reminded and committed to putting people at the centre of what we do while synergizing the tireless efforts of the people connected with our school.

I humbly invite all our valued parents and stakeholders to support and partner us in the road ahead. We did it before and we will do it again in 2022.

<b>T<b>ransforming lives, <b>S<b>yngergising communities.
