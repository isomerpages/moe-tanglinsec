<b><u> ELEMENTS OF THE BADGE </u></b>
<br>
The badge was redesigned at the end of 2015 to mark Tanglin Secondary School’s rebirth as a merged school (between old Tanglin Secondary and Clementi Woods Secondary School).

The main design elements of the badge are as follows:

The <b>PENTAGON<b> symbolises the five main aspects of education: Intellectual, Cultural, Moral, Physical and Aesthetics.

The <b>ARC<b> represents the all-round holistic education that Tanglin Secondary School offers.

The yellow lines radiating from the bottom left corner of the pentagon represent the <b>RAYS OF THE SUN</b>. They are a reminder that all students start as equals when they first enter the school but will eventually graduate and shine as unique individuals with their own skill sets. This ties in with the school philosophy “Everyone is Unique; All can Succeed”.

The rays spread diagonally upwards, signifying the school’s constant growth and success while firmly rooted in our traditions and beginnings. When the rays branch out through the arc, they represent the school pushing beyond boundaries to develop students with the strength and character to shape our nation of the future.
