Overview
--------

The Science Department aims to develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills so that students are able to apply their scientific knowledge and solve real life problems.  
  
We also aim to hone studentsâ€™ curiosity, creativity and innovativeness to enable them to develop new ideas of their own. Through this process students will be inspired to invent new technology and harness them to improve lives.

Similarly, students will be nurtured to become concerned citizens who will learn to use natural resources sustainably and do their part in conserving Earth.
