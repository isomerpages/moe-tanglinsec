### Discipline


#### Overview

<b>Discipline Approach<b>

The mission of the Discipline Committee is to develop each student into a <b>self-disciplined<b> individual.

The discipline approach in Tanglin Secondary School is the 3P Approach:

 <b>Personal Attention<b>:
    <b>  Personal attention is given to students who need to be disciplined. This is to help them review their actions and avoid misbehaviour in future, thus ensuring a conducive learning environment for all.
<b>   <b>Pastoral Care<b>:
    *   Our teachers look beyond discipline into the social-emotional needs of their students.
    *   We study the backgrounds of our students to establish root causes of student misbehaviour.
    *   Teachers and students co-create solutions to the discipline problem.
*   **Parental Involvement:
    *   Our teachers communicate with parents to correct student misbehaviour and work towards a win-win situation.
