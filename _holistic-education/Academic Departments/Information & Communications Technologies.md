## Information & Communication Technologies


### Overview


The ICT department seeks to engage and develop students into future-ready and responsible digital learner. The use of technology in teaching and learning equips students with essential 21st century skills and shapes them into self-directed and collaborative learners.

We equip students with baseline ICT skills through enrichment programmes and lessons involving the use of technology during curriculum.  

The school uses the MOE Cyber Wellness framework to develop the studentsâ€™ instinct to protect and empower themselves to take responsibility for their own well-being in cyberspace.

    <td class="tg-xyrl">The programme is specially designed for students to learn computational thinking and STEM concepts to solve real world problems. Using the Internet of Things(IoT) enabled M5Go microcontroller with LCD screen and a variety of sensors and actuators, students made prototypes that require wireless connectivity to solve problem posed.<br>The students also use Cardboard Lego pieces known as Blokies, upcycled materials and the easy to use drag and drop web-based programming platform UiFlow to create different prototypes quickly to reinforce their understanding.</td>
