## Student Development & Well-Being


### Overview


The Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) Department aims to imbue the school’s core values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Curiosity to Learn in our students, as well as to build their social-emotional skills.

  
The CCE programmes comprise the formal CCE curriculum – the BASIC programme, as well as experiential learning programmes through the Education & Career Guidance programme, Values-In-Action programme, Cyber wellness programme, Sexuality Education programme, and the National Education programme.  
The department also looks into the well-being of the students through processes like positive teacher-student relations, the teacher-pupil interactions, counselling programmes, financial assistance programmes, and intervention programmes.
