# BASIC Programme


The BASIC Education Programme, which stands for Belief, Affective Values, Social Intelligences, Imagination and Competencies, is the formal instructional curriculum of our school’s Character and Citizenship Education Programme, explicit teaching of school values, social emotional competencies and life skills.

BASIC also focuses on three big ideas – identity, relationships and choices, and allows students to relate to the issues surrounding these ideas.
