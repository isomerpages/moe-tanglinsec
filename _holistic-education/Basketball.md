Basketball
==========

Overview
--------

Tanglin Basketball aims to impart values and skills to our players. We focus on teamwork, discipline and resilience during our training. Our players have the opportunity to partner with external organisations in terms of training and exchange of skills. Through rigorous post-game reflections, our players are more aware of their strengths and weaknesses.
