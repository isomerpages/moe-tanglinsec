# Aesthetics Programme


The Aesthetics Education Programme (AP) was started in 2005 with the aim of developing socially confident and expressive ­teenagers who enjoy the fine arts. Based on our school’s sustained achievements in SYF Music and Dance Central Judging (1999-2003), a 3-tier Dance Education Programme (DEP) became the focal point from 2005 to 2010.

In 2011, in response to the AP student feedback, the Pop Vocal and Guitar Education modules were added to the existing Dance Education Programme (DEP) which was then renamed “Aesthetics Education Programme (AP)”.

All lower secondary students are exposed to 2 years of dance technique training and training lessons in stage craft and production management. In the second tier, dance talents are identified and groomed to participate in the annual Anti-Drug Danceworks as well as the Asia Pacific Competition organised by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and Commonwealth Society of Teachers of Dancing (CSTD) respectively.

Dance, Vocal and Drama talents are showcased in our semestral lunchtime concerts, major school events as well as school musicals “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat” (2004), “The Chorus Line” (2008) and “The Wizard of Oz” (2010). The school has also been featured in recent events such as the annual International Water Festival, Youth Olympics Games (2010) and Chingay under the kind support of our external partners, Singapore Polytechnic, Southwest CDC as well as the Mexican Embassy.

In the 3rd tier development, 20 students are exposed to a 40-hour Advanced Elective Module (AEM) on “Performance and Production Management”.
