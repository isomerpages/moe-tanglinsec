## Co-Curricular Activities


CCAs are an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation.

**CCA LEAPS 2.0**

As part of its efforts to provide students with a holistic and well-rounded experience in the co-curriculum, the Ministry of Education (MOE) implemented an updated LEAPS framework, LEAPS 2.0 from 2014. The updated framework enabled schools to better align their co-curriculum to encourage students’ holistic development in terms of life skills, competencies and values. Students will be recognised with levels of attainment in four domains: Leadership, Achievement, Participation and Service.
