ECG Programmes

**1\. Library ECG Corner**

Look out for this designated corner in the library, stacked with useful ECG resources such as collaterals, brochures and course booklets from post-secondary education institutes as well as career guide books and fact sheets. Come and explore!

**2\. Career Day @ Cohort Camp**

Career day is an annual programme for graduating students, whereby postsecondary education institutes lecturers or industry professionals share course information or career pathways with the students. To cater to students who need additional education and career resources, education booths are also set up with these collaterals and resources. In 2019, instead of bringing in industry speakers to conduct talks for the students, students went on learning journeys to their preferred industries to gain relevant handson experiences. We also have our own in-house ICT trainer to train our students in creating selfmarketing videos that would be helpful for students in their applications for postsecondary schools or educational institutes. This would enable students to gain greater self-understanding and prepare our students for a future in which video resumes are gaining traction.

3\. Learning Journeys Learning journeys to various companies are organised for students throughout the year by working closely with organisations like Children’s Wishing Well. Through these learning journeys, students gain better insights of the industries and are given the opportunities to experience on the job learning through hands-on and authentic tasks.

**4\. Advanced Elective Modules (AEMs) and Elective Modules (EMs)**

In 2019, students who are taking Principles of Account (POA) participated in the AEM, “Start your Business Now”, organised by Republic Polytechnic during the March Holidays. This programme seeks to equip students with the fundamental principles of entrepreneurship and business management. Through the programme, students will be exposed to the experience of starting their own business and managing it. The programme progressively brings students through the enterprise creation process, enabling them to develop a simple business plan and execute it in a systematic, efficient and effective manner. At the end of the module, students are to run a business via a pushcart sales model to apply what they have learnt. Our Sec 3N(A) and 3N(T) students will be taking part in the CAT A EM conducted by various ITE colleges in March and July. The modules are “Introduction to Restaurant Services”, “Video Production”, “Social Media Content Development” and “Building Models with 3D printers”. Through these modules, students will get a glimpse of ITE’s range of full time courses and possible career paths, thereby enabling them to make informed choices upon graduation from secondary school.

**5\. ECG Lessons**

ECG lessons are conducted for all secondary school students, with a minimum of 4 hours of ECG lesson delivery each year. The emphasis at the secondary school level is on career exploration. The goal is to deepen students’ self-understanding and relate schooling to different education and career pathways. Students would: – explore the career world – understand the relevant courses of study – develop awareness of their skills, interests and values.
