# Fencing


## Overview 


Tanglin was the first Technical school to introduce fencing as an extra-curricular activity (ECA) in 1964.  It remains as one of the main sports Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) offered to our students. We aim to nurture fencers who can demonstrate greater competence in the areas of self-management, self-awareness, responsible decision-making, social awareness and relationship management.  These Social and Emotional competencies will serve as a driving force to enable our Tanglin fencers to succeed in the 21st Century.
