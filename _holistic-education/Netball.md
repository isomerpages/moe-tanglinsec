# Netball


## Overview 


Netball is a CCA that inculcates the importance of sportsmanship, teamwork and resilience in our players. During weekly trainings, they will acquire the basic knowledge, fitness, skills and strategies required to excel in Netball. Annual competitions and sports camps further provide opportunities for players to develop their leadership and life skills. In addition, they will also forge long lasting friendships both within the team and with the alumni.
