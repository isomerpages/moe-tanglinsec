# Volleyball


## Overview&nbsp;


Volleyball was formed in 2009 and is one of the most popular sports CCAs in the school. Besides learning ball-handling skills and techniques from our professional full-time coach and our teacher-in-charge, our volleyball members also learn about discipline, respect and teamwork**.**&nbsp;School team members gradually learn about dedication and commitment**,**&nbsp;as they find the balance between school work and sports.
