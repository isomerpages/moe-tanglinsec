## Academic Support Programme


The school conducts Academic Support Programmes (ASP) on every Tues and even week Thurs afternoon for Sec 1 to Sec 5 students who require them.

Parents/Guardians can check your children’s handbook to see if they have been asked to attend ASP. Please call the school’s General Office if you are unsure of your children’s ASP schedule.
