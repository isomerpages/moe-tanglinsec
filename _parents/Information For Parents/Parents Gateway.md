## Parents Gateway


Dear Parents,

Parents Gateway is a mobile app developed by MOE to enable parents/guardians to stay connected with the school at your convenience through your smartphones. PG allows parents/legal guardians to

(i) give consent for your school child’s/ward’s activities,

(ii) receive announcement and updates directly from the school,

(iii) keep track of upcoming events and updates effortlessly.

In view of the benefits brought about by PG, we strongly encourage all parents to download and use this App. Moreover, parents will stop receiving hardcopy notification letters and consent forms from the school by **June 2019**.

Should you face any difficulty receiving notifications or giving consent through Parents Gateway, please contact Tanglin General Office at 64248200.
