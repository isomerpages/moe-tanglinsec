## [Parents in Education (PiE)](http://parents-in-education.moe.gov.sg/) 


As a parent, you have a unique overview of the home and school environments that will greatly influence your child’s attitudes, beliefs, values and behaviour. You want the best for your child and to help your child get the most out of his/her school experience. As schools make the shift to 21st century learning, today’s classrooms would differ greatly from what you remember of your classroom when you were a student. Guiding your child through this exciting educational journey is a wonderful privilege that parents and educators share. We invite you to navigate and access the resources and information on this website – a website intended to bring you into the shared journey of educating your child.
