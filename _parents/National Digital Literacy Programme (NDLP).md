## National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)


### National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)

### \[For Secondary 2, 3 and 4 Students\]

At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (**NDLP**) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (**PDLP**) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (**PLD**) by end-2021. This page provides important information about the PDLP and how you can purchase the PLD for your child/ward as well as about the accompanying applications that the school may be rolling out as part of the NDLP.

The school have identified the PLD to be Apple iPad. It is important for all students to have the same PLDs so as to have a coherent teaching and learning ecosystem in the school.

**Personal Learning Device (PLD) for Secondary School Students**

**Overview.** The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.

**Purchase of PLD Bundle.** The school has made arrangements for you to purchase the PLD from AsiaPac Distribution Pte Ltd (vendor) for your child’s/ward’s use in school. The vendor has been identified based on the choice of device determined by the school from a panel of awarded suppliers established by MOE. The PLD bundle which includes warranty and insurance for purchase by your child/ward will be:

**DMA After-School** **Parent Options**

Device Management Application (DMA) software is installed in students’ PLDs to provide a safer digital learning environment, and to prevent misuse of the device. Parents/guardians can choose between these 3 options to suit their preferences for managing the PLDs **after school hours**.

Parents can make a new request to change their choice of DMA option, by submitting the request through the link [https://go.gov.sg/dma-option-request](https://go.gov.sg/dma-option-request) or the QR code by **21st of the calendar month**.

The request wil processed by the school at the start of the following month.

(No action is needed for parents who are keeping their existing DMA option)
