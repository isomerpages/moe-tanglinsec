The development of a young person’s understanding of society, through the acquisition of future-relevant knowledge and skills, will enable him or her to actively contribute in a technologically-advanced world, where humans and technology have to complement and collaborate.  

  

The ALP brings together different school experiences to enable the progressive development of every student through A.C.E.:

  

 Authentic Experiences with interdisciplinary learning, public agencies and industry partners

  

 Community Networking with [](https://tanglinsec.moe.edu.sg/homepage/character-development/student-leadership/)[Student Leadership](https://tanglinsec.moe.edu.sg/homepage/character-development/student-leadership/) and Values-In-Action Programmes
