### Learning for Life Programme (LLP)
<br> 
<br>
Tanglinians are no strangers to creative expression. Every Tanglinian is exposed to the arts through the TSS Arts Programme – our distinctive Learning for Life Programme (LLP).

The journey of experiencing and performing the arts at Tanglin helps our students discover their interests and deepen their talents in Music, Dance and Visual Art.

*   In Sec 1: Students enjoy broad-based exposure to various art forms, namely dance, guitar and acrylic painting
*   In Sec 2: Students exercise choice on which talent development electives to take, to deepen their skills and interest in an art form – show choir, dance, guitar, batik painting.
*   In Sec 3: Students’ horizons are broadened through collaborations with partners such as NAFA and NAC which offer exciting glimpses of enriching career opportunities in the arts scene.

Through their journey in the arts, students develop an aesthetic sensibility, build deep skills, and most importantly, discover new insights about themselves. As they engage in arts performances and exhibitions, Tanglinians find and can nurture their own voices to express themselves confidently and creatively.

We raise the platforms for Tanglinians to not only showcase their talents, but to also find ways of harnessing the arts to bring joy to those around them. Students enrich community life through public performances at events like the West Coast Constituency National Day Dinner and Ayer Rajah CC Chinese New Year Celebration. This year, we also launched our inaugural Arts Fiesta@TSS 2018(AF@TSS) to promote visual and performing arts in schools with funding from National Arts Council on 6 April 2018. It is open to&nbsp;Primary Six students from the West Zone Primary Schools.
