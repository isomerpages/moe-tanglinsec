### Student Leadership
<br>

##### EVERY TANGLINIAN A LEADER
<br>

###### OUR BELIEFS IN STUDENT LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT

We believe that <b>every Tanglinian can be and should be developed as a leader<b> who makes a positive difference to others within his/her sphere of influence. In line with our school’s vision, all students, regardless of their education levels, courses of study and whether they hold formal leadership positions, have the potential to be leaders. All students will be imbued with core values that will anchor them in life, and have the opportunity to develop and strengthen leadership competencies through key student development experiences and CCE lessons, to become <b>Leaders of the Future, Pride of the Community<b>.

<u> <b>OUR STUDENT LEADERSHIP FRAMEWORK<b> <u>

This framework provides an overview of our approach and programmes which support the development of leadership skills and competencies in our students.

	Our student leadership development programmes are based on Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary Student Leadership:

1.  <b>Model The Way<b>– A Tanglin student leader serves as a positive role model for his/her peers by behaving in ways that reflect the school values.
2.  <b>Inspire a Shared Vision<b> – A Tanglin student leader envisions the future and enlists others to make it their common vision.
3.  <b>Challenge the Process<b> – A Tanglin student leader seeks opportunities to grow, dares to experiment, takes risks and learns from mistakes.
4.  <b>Enable others to act<b> – A Tanglin student leader fosters collaboration by building trusting relationships, and strengthens others by developing competence.
5.  <b>Encourage the heart<b> – A Tanglin student leader recognises his/her teammates’ contributions to the success of the project and celebrates team achievements.

	##### OUR STUDENT LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE

	Our Student Leadership Development Programme comprises three tiers, starting with <b>Self-Leadership<b> as the foundation. Students learn that leadership is a disposition rather than a position. The knowledge, skills and values articulated across the CCE2021 curriculum form the baseline of leadership knowledge, values and competencies for all students.

Key student development experiences such as Values in Action, cohort camps and CCA provide opportunities for students to strengthen these leadership competencies. Every Secondary One student will also be guided in fulfilling the requirements of the three key components of the National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) Bronze Award programme, namely Service Learning, Outdoor Appreciation and Healthy Living (Physical & Mental Wellness), in line with the school’s desired outcomes of nurturing self-directed learners and concerned citizens. After achieving the NYAA Bronze Award, students are offered the Silver Award programme to further develop their leadership skills and competencies, and contribute to service learning in greater depth.
