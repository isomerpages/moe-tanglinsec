## SDL – The Curious Tanglinian


<b>The Curious Tanglinian</b>

The Curious Tanglinian is a Tanglinian who exhibits the school value <b>‘Curiosity to Learn’</b>. This student is eager to <b>explore</b> different topics of his/her interest and finds <b>joy</b> doing so.

Sec 1-3 students will get the opportunity to explore their interests and develop new ones for at least 1 hour on the Self-Directed Learning (SDL) days in Term 3!

This segment is called ‘The Curious Tanglinian’ segment.
